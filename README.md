# Discrete Structures for Computer Science Assignment

This assignment was made for as part of the Discrete Structures for Computer Science course at BITS Pilani (CS F222). The problem statement is described in the PDF file `Programming_Assignment.pdf`.

For compiling, the makefile can be run by simply typing `make` in the terminal of any Unix-based OS. Make sure that the Python environment that is activated in the terminal by default has the packages listed in `requirements.txt`. To remove the compiled files, type `make clean`. To run the main program, `cd` into `bin` and type `./main.exe`.

The program can also take any custom file as input - for this, when executing the `.exe`, just type the name of the file in as a command line argument. By default, the file is assumed to be in the root directory of the project. We have added two CSV files, "subsets.csv" and "divides.csv" for this purpose.
